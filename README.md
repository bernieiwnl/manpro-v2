# MANPRO (acronym of Management Project)
I develop this web app to practice my JS framework skill and sharpen my knowledge for building clean architecture software.
This project is not limited to reactjs only. Soon i'll build the similar project or working with another idea using svelte svelte. 

## This project follows bulletproof-react github repo
### One of the best guideline to build a react app with a great architecture
### Link : https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md

#### To be used packages
react-task-gantt
react-big-calendar
https://github.com/rcdexta/react-trello (nanti aja kalau gantt chart udah fix)
https://github.com/plouc/nivo (belum pasti, nanti kalau sudah butuh)



Soon, i'll learn how to develop software with MVVM architecture after i finished this project.
